do even greater things for Joseph’s *descendants.
The son who had the *birthright used to receive a double share of
his father’s possessions. The *descendants of each son of Jacob became a
*tribe. But Joseph’s *descendants became two *tribes: Ephraim and Manasseh. And
they were both large *tribes.
v27‘Benjamin is like a greedy *wolf.
In the morning, the *wolf eats whatever it has hunted.
In the evening, the *wolf tears apart the animals that it
has taken.’
Verse 27 People from the *tribe of Benjamin would have a tendency
to fight. In Judges chapter 20, this attitude caused a terrible war between the
*tribe of Benjamin and the other *tribes. The *tribe of Benjamin refused to
hand over criminals for punishment. Instead, the *tribe of Benjamin decided to
fight.
The men from the *tribe of Benjamin were brave soldiers. But they
still lost the battle. Nearly everyone from the *tribe of Benjamin died. Only
600 men from the *tribe of Benjamin escaped.
Many years afterwards, the first king of Israel, called Saul,
came from the *tribe of Benjamin. Saul became a cruel king.
Paul too belonged to the *tribe of Benjamin (Philippians 3:5).
Paul had this tendency too, but he used it in a good way. He was brave. And he
was not afraid to suffer (2 Corinthians 11:23-29).
v28All those are Israel’s 12 *tribes. That is what their
father said to them. He said it when he *blessed them. He *blessed each son
with the *blessing that was right for that son.
v29Then Israel gave these orders to his sons. He
said, ‘God will soon gather me to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave.
It is in the field of Ephron the *Hittite.v30That cave is in the field
at Machpelah. It is east from Mamre, in the country called Canaan. Abraham
bought the field from Ephron the *Hittite. So then Abraham had a place to bury
people.v31There people buried Abraham and his wife Sarah. There they
buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah. I buried Leah there.v32Abraham
bought that field and he bought the cave in it. He bought them from Heth’s
family.’
v33Jacob (Israel) gave those orders to his sons.
When he had finished, he pulled his feet up onto the bed. He breathed his last
breath and he died.
Verse 28 This is the first time in Genesis when the writer writes
about ‘Israel’s 12 *tribes’.
Verse 29 Jacob told his sons that he was dying. He said, ‘God
will soon gather me to my people.’ Maybe he used these words to show that there
is life after death. We do not know whether he did. Jacob may have meant only
that his body would be with his dead relatives (verses 30-32). Jacob insisted
that his sons should bury him in Canaan. Canaan was the country that God had
promised to them. The sons needed to remember that. Their *descendants would
not always remain in Egypt.
v1Then Joseph bent over his father’s face. He wept
and he kissed his father.v2Joseph had some servants that were doctors.
He ordered them to *preserve his father. So the doctors *preserved Israel.v3They worked for 40 days. It takes 40 days to *preserve a body. The *Egyptians
wept about Israel for 70 days.
v4Then the days when the *Egyptians wept were over.
Joseph then spoke to *Pharaoh’s family. He said, ‘Please do this kind thing for
me and speak to *Pharaoh.v5Please tell him that my father made me
declare a very serious promise. Israel said to me, “I will soon die. Bury me in
the grave that I bought for myself. I bought it in the country called Canaan.
Bury me there!” Please ask *Pharaoh if I can go to bury my father. Then I will
come back.’
v6*Pharaoh replied, ‘Go up and bury your father. Do
it exactly as you promised to him.’
v7So Joseph went up to bury his father. And all
*Pharaoh’s servants went with him. So did the older men in his own family, who
had authority in the family. So did all the older men that had authority in the
country called Egypt.v8Joseph’s brothers and Israel’s family went up
too, as well as Joseph’s family. They left only their children behind them (in
Goshen). Their *flocks and *herds stayed in the region called Goshen.v9Joseph had with him *chariots and also horsemen. It was a very large group.
v10Joseph and his group came to a flat, open place
where people separated the grains from corn. It was at Atad. That was in the
country called Canaan, beyond the Jordan River. Then Joseph and his group
cried. They cried for a very long time and they cried with deep emotion. Joseph
arranged a special occasion when people could cry about his father. They cried
for 7 days.v11The *Canaanites that were living in the area saw it.
They saw how Joseph’s group cried there. That was at Atad. It was in the place
where people separate the grains from corn. The *Canaanites said, ‘The
*Egyptians are very sad about this.’ So the place was called Abel-Mizraim. It
is beyond the Jordan River.
v12So Israel’s sons did as he had ordered them.v13His sons carried him to the country called Canaan. They buried him in the cave
in the field. The field is at Machpelah, east from Mamre. It is the field that
Abraham bought from Ephron the *Hittite. Abraham bought it as a place to bury
people.v14Joseph went back to Egypt after he had buried his father.
Joseph’s brothers also went back to Egypt. And many other people had gone up
with him to bury his father. They all went back to Egypt.
v15Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was then
dead. They thought that Joseph might hate them. And he might punish the
brothers for all the evil things that they had done to him.v16So they
sent a person to take a message to Joseph. The person told this message to him:
‘Before your father died, he ordered us to talk to you.v17Your father
said, “Say this to Joseph. Say that he should forgive his brothers for the
evil, wrong things that they did to him. Joseph should forgive them for the bad
things that they did.” Now please, we desperately ask you to forgive us for our
*sins. We are the servants of your father’s God.’ Joseph wept when that person
told that message to him.
v18Joseph’s brothers themselves came and they *bowed
down low in front of him. They said, ‘Look! We are your servants.’
v19Joseph said to them, ‘Do not be afraid. I am not
God.v20You certainly meant to do an evil thing to me, but God meant it
for a good purpose. So, because of that, many people are alive until today.v21Do not be afraid. I will take care of you. And I will take care of your little
children.’ In that way, Joseph helped them not to be afraid any longer. So they
became calm. He comforted them.
v22So Joseph lived in Egypt. His father’s family
lived there too. Joseph lived for 110 years.v23Joseph saw Ephraim’s
grandchildren. Manasseh’s son Machir also had children, whom Joseph took into
his own family.
v24Joseph said to his brothers, ‘I am dying. God
will come to you. And he will take you up out of this country. He will lead you
to the country that he promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.’v25Joseph
then made Israel’s sons promise something very seriously to him (Joseph).
Joseph ordered them to do this thing. He said that God would come to the family
and then they must carry up his bones out of Egypt.
v26So Joseph died when he was 110 years old. People
*preserved him. And they put him in a coffin (big box to bury people in). The
coffin was in Egypt.
Jacob had asked his sons to bury his body in Canaan. So, after
Jacob’s death, Joseph arranged for the funeral to be in Canaan.
It was not just Jacob’s family who attended the funeral. Many
*Egyptians came to the funeral too. This fact shows how many people respected
Jacob. It took several days to travel from Egypt to Canaan. And it was a
difficult journey.
After the funeral, Joseph’s brothers became afraid of him again.
They thought that he might be angry with them. They thought that he might
punish them.
Joseph wept when he heard about their fears. He never wanted to
be cruel to his brothers. He had forgiven them. He was sad that they did not
seem to realise this. So, he explained that God placed him in Egypt in order to
do God’s work. Their actions had been evil. But they could not prevent God from
doing something good.
Joseph was an old man when he died. Before he died, he gave an
instruction to his family. He did not want them to bury his body in Egypt.
Instead, he asked them to store his bones. At the right time, God would take
their *descendants back to Canaan. (God promised this to Abraham in Genesis
15:13-16.) And Joseph wanted them to take his bones with them. Joseph showed by
these instructions that he trusted God (Hebrews 11:22).
And the *descendants of Joseph’s family did what he wanted
(Exodus 13:19; Joshua 24:32).
Verse 1 There was special love between Joseph and Jacob. There were
several reasons why such love existed between them. Joseph was the son of
Rachel, Jacob’s favourite wife. Jacob and Rachel had waited for many years
before Joseph was born. Jacob and Joseph were away from each other for many
years. They had not thought that they would meet each other again. But
particularly, they felt this love because they both served God. So, they both
had the same attitudes.
Joseph was a very important person in Egypt. So, when his father
was dying, Joseph would be the chief person by his father’s bed. God had
promised that Joseph would close Jacob’s eyes when Jacob died (Genesis 46:4).
Verse 2 *Egyptians used to *preserve dead bodies. This was a
special ceremony in their religion. So, usually, their priests did this task.
But Joseph and Jacob did not belong to the ancient *Egyptian religion. Instead,
they served the real God. So, Joseph arranged for doctors (instead of priests)
to *preserve Jacob’s body.
Verse 3 ‘40 days’ may mean ‘a long time’ in the *Old Testament.
However, it may actually mean 40 days here, because the writer mentions other
such times also. People were usually sad for dead kings for 72 days. Jacob’s
family considered him very important. The *Egyptians, too, considered him
important, because he was Joseph’s father.
Verse 4 Joseph did not go to *Pharaoh himself. Probably, people
did not usually go to a king while they were sad. It was probably not right to
do that. Jacob wanted his family to bury him in Canaan because of God’s
promises. But Joseph did not mention that reason. Perhaps he thought that it
might not be polite to the people in Egypt. Joseph talked about the matter
gently. He also spoke about a grave that Jacob had made for himself. Joseph did
not mention that the graves of Jacob’s relatives were in the same place. Some
translations have ‘the grave that I cut (out of the rock)’.
Verse 5 Joseph promised to return to Egypt.
Verse 7 All *Pharaoh’s *Egyptian servants went with Joseph. In
that way, they showed great honour towards Joseph and Jacob. Perhaps the *Egyptians
also wanted to be sure that Joseph would come back to Egypt.
Jacob’s funeral was a very great occasion.
Verse 9 The *descendants of people that went to the funeral would
follow the *Israelites later. They chased the *Israelites when the *Israelites
left Egypt for Canaan. But then, at that later time, the *Egyptians and the
*Israelites were enemies.
Verse 10 We are not sure where this place was. It was usual to
cry and be sad for 7 days. To separate the grains from the corn, people beat
the corn. Each farmer chose a special area with flat ground for this task.
Verse 11 People could see that Joseph’s group were very sad. And
people could hear it. The group made a noise and they probably tore their
clothes. Probably, they threw ashes over their bodies and they shaved their
hair. And they cried loudly. The name Abel-Mizraim meant that the *Egyptians
were very sad there.
Verse 13 It seems that only Jacob’s family went further to his
burial. (A burial is when people bury a dead person in the ground.) The *Egyptians
stayed at Abel-Mizraim. Families usually buried their dead relatives in
private.
Verse 14 Joseph did as he had promised to *Pharaoh. He returned
to Egypt. Actually, many people went back together to Egypt. But Joseph was the
most important person.
Verse 15 ‘Saw’ here means knew. The brothers were afraid. They
thought that maybe Joseph would not still be friendly to them. Perhaps he was
kind in the past only because he loved his father. So, Joseph’s brothers were
afraid that he might now punish them. He was very powerful.
Verses 16-17 The writer does not tell us whether Jacob really
told the brothers to say those things. The brothers had done bad things to
Joseph. But we do not know whether Jacob ever knew that. Jacob would have
wanted the family to be friendly, because God had promised great things for
their future.
Maybe the brothers had not asked Joseph to forgive them before.
If they had, we do not know it. But now, they asked him clearly to forgive
them. They even offered to become his slaves.
Their message upset Joseph. He had already forgiven them. But it
seems that they still did not realise this fact.
Their attitude was like many people today. God wants to forgive
us because he is kind. He sent Jesus to die for us. Because of Jesus, God will
forgive us if we humbly confess our evil deeds to him. Then, if we invite God
into our lives, we become friends of God. But many people think that they must
earn this by their own efforts. They are wrong. God forgives us as a free gift.
God makes us his friends because he loves us.
Verses 19-20 Although Joseph had a lot of wealth and power, he
had not become proud and unkind. He knew that God is the judge over everyone.
He knew that God is always good. And God is powerful. Our evil deeds cannot
stop God’s plans to do good things. God had a plan to use Joseph. And God’s
plan succeeded. He used Joseph to save people’s lives.
Verse 21 Joseph promised to provide for his brothers’ families.
They would be safe then. And they would continue to be safe during his whole
life.
Verse 22 Joseph lived until he was very old.
Verse 23 In the *Hebrew of this verse, it is not clear whether
the children were Ephraim’s grandchildren or Joseph’s grandchildren. Joseph
adopted Manasseh’s grandchildren.
Verse 24 Joseph believed God’s promise that God would give the
country called Canaan to the *Israelites. It is unlikely that many of Joseph’s
actual brothers were still alive. The verse probably means that he spoke these
words to his brothers’ families.
Verse 25 ‘Israel’s sons’ probably means Jacob’s grandsons,
grandsons’ sons, and other *descendants. All Joseph’s brothers were older than
he was, except Benjamin. Joseph used this promise to remind his family that he
trusted God. And Joseph wanted them to trust God too.
Verse 26 Usually, the *Israelites buried bodies soon after death.
But Joseph wanted the *Israelites to remember God’s promises. So, he told them
not to bury his body. Instead, he told them to put it in a coffin. (A coffin is
a big box that someone has made out of wood. People place dead bodies in it.)
Whenever the *Israelites saw that coffin, they remembered God’s promise to
them. God had promised that they would live in Canaan. It took several
centuries before their *descendants arrived in Canaan. But, in the end, God did
for them what he had promised. And, at last, they buried Joseph’s bones in the
country that God promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

The EasyEnglish Bible is an easy Bible to read and understand in simple modern English. It is based on a vocabulary of 1200 common English words. It is ideal for people who are learning English or speak English as a foreign language. For more details, seeWhat is the EasyEnglish Bible?
It is a “meaning-for-meaning” translation – not “word-for-word”.
We have translated the meaning of the original message as clearly and accurately as we can in plain English.
We have changed the order of words if that makes the meaning clearer in English.
The EasyEnglish Bible has been translated by theEasyEnglish Bible Translation Team

FAQ.
MostEasyEnglishpublications are available in
two formats: HTML and RTF. Some are available in DOC format or ZIP (Zipped RTF)
format.
Using HTML(to
view, print and download a document)
If you just want to look at a document on the screen, the
quickest way is to click on the HTML link. If you want to, you
can then use the File menu on your browser to print the document
or save it onto your computer.
Using RTF(to
download a document)

the formatting of a publication. You can use your word processor
to change the fonts, the page size and so on.
To download an RTF file:
Once you have downloaded the RTF file you can open it in your
word processor. To open an RTF file:
The following word processors can all open RTF files:
If you are using one of these, and you don't have a 'Rich Text
Format' entry in your 'Files of Type' list, or if when you open
the file you see a lot of garbled text, you may be missing the
RTF translator for your word processor. Contact the technical
support for your software.
If your favourite word processor is not on this list, check
your manual to see if you are able to open RTF files.
Using DOC(to
download a document)
Some documents are available as DOC files instead of RTF. This is because the
RTF would take too long to download. You can download a DOC file in exactly the
same way as an RTF file.
Using ZIP(to
